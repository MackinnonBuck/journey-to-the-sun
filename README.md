## About

This project is a real-time animated music video for the song ["The Sun"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxpjONrpV6w) by Parov Stelar, created using C++ and OpenGL. The lyrics of the song allude to a protagonist who urges to leave home and explore foreign places by following the sun. Our story features an astronaut living in a distant space station outpost far from the sun, and the astronaut decides to leave this space station home and begin a lone journey towards the sun.

## Repository structure

Each branch with the `scene-` prefix contains the code to render one of the scenes of the animation. The music video was created by taking separate screen-captures of the program rendering each scene and splicing them together in an external video editing program.
